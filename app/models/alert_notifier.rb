    # happened and we can check whether is was sucessful?
    # TODO: Once we put caching in place this will mean that the stats will be updated frequently during the sending
    # out of all the email alerts. This means that the cache will be continuously dirtied during the email alerts
    # and the performance of all the page loads will suffer (as they contain statistics)

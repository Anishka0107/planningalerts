    %h3 Thanks, your alert has been activated
    %p
      You will now receive email alerts for any planning applications we find within <strong>#{meters_in_words(@alert.radius_meters)}</strong>
      of <strong>#{@alert.address}</strong>.

    You can #{link_to "change the size of the area covered by the alerts", area_alert_path(id: @alert.confirm_id)}
    now or at a later time. Every email alert will have this link.
    If you want alerts around another address as well
    #{link_to "you can sign up for multiple alerts", new_alert_path}.

      #{link_to "A subscription costs $49 per month", new_subscription_url(email: @alert.email)}.
      Once you’re subscribed you can get alerts from as many locations as you need.
    - # TODO: Make this a test for if the trial has just been created, rather than its length
    - # Because if you sign up for another alert on the same day you'll see this again.

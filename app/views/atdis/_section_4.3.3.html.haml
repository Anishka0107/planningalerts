  <h4 id="section4.3.3">4.3.3 Location [L1]</h4>

  The `location` record is designed to provide consumers with information about the geographic location of the development application. Because not all Authorities have access to geographic information for their development applications, parts of this record are optional. If a feed includes the location record at all, it must include the `address` and `land_title_ref` attributes within the record.

  It is mandatory that feeds provide the location record with the `address` and `land_title_ref` fields, and it is anticipated that future versions of the Specification will promote the coordinates field into mandatory compliance.

  **Notes**

  * In each case the values for `lot`, `section` and `dpsp_id` should all be captured as strings.
  * When used, GPS coordinates must make use of the WGS84 datum as per *"Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008)"*. See: [http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/index.html](http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/index.html) for details.
  * The format for geographic coordinates must use the GeoJSON specification as per: [http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#geojson-objects](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#geojson-objects)
  * The simplest compliant version of a geometry instance would be a *Point* of the form:

    ```
    { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [100.0, 0.0] }
    ```

    Point coordinates are in x, y order (easting, northing for projected coordinates, longitude, latitude for geographic coordinates). For more advanced geometric types, please refer to the GeoJSON specification.
  * As `geometry` is optional for the Location block in ATDIS-1.0.7, there is no requirement to specify the kinds of geometric data for an application. However, if a feed is supplying geometric data, then it must be formatted according to the GeoJSON specification.
  * In general, the `dpsp_id` will start with either the letters `SP` or `DP`, and be followed by a number.
  * If the `section` value in `land_title_ref` is not available, then it should be populated with the value `"none"`.

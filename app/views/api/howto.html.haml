  Planning application data is available programmatically as feeds which can
  be used in most web mapping APIs and desktop GIS software like <a href="http://mapufacture.com">mapufacture</a>
  and <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a>. Details of the API are listed below.
%p
  Non-commercial, low-volume use of this service is free.
  = link_to "Read more.", :anchor => "hLicenseInfo"
%p
  All the API calls listed below return planning application sorted by the date they were scraped from the planning authority website with the most
  recent listed first. They will return a maximum of #{Application.per_page} results. To retrieve more results simply append "&amp;<strong>page</strong>=[2,3,etc..]" to the url.
%p
  By appending "&amp;<strong>style</strong>=html" to the end of the url it will return an html formatted
  description in the georss feed rather than the default plain text. This is especially
  useful when a georss feed is embedded in a map as in the examples below.
%p
  The API can return different formats including <a href="http://www.georss.org/">GeoRSS</a> and <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>. The examples below all return
  GeoRSS. To get JSON instead simply replace ".rss" in the URL with ".js".

    The Application Tracking Data Interchange Specification (ATDIS) is a modern, straightforward specification for publishing development
    applications online in a consistent machine readable format. It has been developed by the
    = link_to "NSW Department of Planning & Infrastructure", "http://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/"
    and
    = link_to "Carpadium Pty Ltd", "http://www.carpadium.com/"
    in cooperation with a number of software vendors and
    #{link_to "the OpenAustralia Foundation", "http://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au"}.
  %p
    This page allows software vendors to automatically check that their ATDIS feed is compliant with the specification.

  Warning - This is <strong>alpha</strong> software. Most of the core validation functionality is available but the user
  interface is still in a very early stage of development. Also, there might be unexpected bugs. Beware!

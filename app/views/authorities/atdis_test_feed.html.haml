    The Application Tracking Data Interchange Specification (ATDIS) is a modern, straightforward specification for publishing development
    applications online in a consistent machine readable format. It has been developed by the
    = link_to "NSW Department of Planning & Infrastructure", "http://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/"
    and
    = link_to "Carpadium Pty Ltd", "http://www.carpadium.com/"
    in cooperation with a number of software vendors and
    #{link_to "the OpenAustralia Foundation", "http://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au"}.
  %p
    This page allows software vendors to automatically check that their ATDIS feed is compliant with the specification. It currently validates against version 1.0.4 of the specification.
%p
  Warning - This is <strong>alpha</strong> software. Most of the core validation functionality is available but the user
  interface is still in a very early stage of development. Things might change without warning. Also, there might be unexpected bugs. Beware!

      %strong Success!
      We've not found any errors on this page. It's worth looking through the information below to see how the data is actually loaded to double check that everything is as expected.
    %p
      Also, to check that the whole feed is working you need to check that the other pages are working. See the "Test previous page" and "Test next page" buttons above.
    %h3 How the applications get loaded

      Note that the field names (and some of the block level indentation) here is different than the json and this is showing all L1, L2 and L3 parameters, irrespective of whether they were actually used or not.

  You can help by writing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_scraping">screen scraper</a>
  for your local planning authority, all without leaving your web browser, in any one of your favorite languages: Ruby, Python or PHP. #{link_to "Read our step-by-step instructions", how_to_write_a_scraper_path}.

  I work for a local council or planning authority and would like to make our data available

  The most important thing you can do is publish your data in a simple format that is freely available on the internet.
  Something <a href="/brisbane.xml">like this</a> is good but we can work with most formats. Please
  #{mail_to "contact@planningalerts.org.au", "get in touch"} if you would like to discuss how you can help.

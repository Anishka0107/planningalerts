  I am a programmer and want to add my local planning authority
%p
  You can help by writing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_scraping">screen scraper</a>
  for your local planning authority, all without leaving your web browser, in any one of your favorite languages: Ruby, Python or PHP.

  I'm not technical and I want to get my local authority on to PlanningAlerts. What can I do?
%p
  You can lobby your local authority to publish its planning data in a machine readable format. Email the council planning department and General Manager. Contact your councillors and get them to support your mission.
%p
  Use Mosman Council as an example of what good local authorities can do. See #{link_to "this link", "http://portal.mosman.nsw.gov.au/pages/xc.track/ChooseFeed.aspx"}. They provide a list of machine readable feeds which are licensed under a Creative Commons license.

  In NSW,
  = link_to "The Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009", "http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/viewtop/inforce/act+52+2009+FIRST+0+N/"
  (the GIPA Act), place requirements on local councils to publish the information they hold about development applications on their websites. See
  = link_to "this report", "http://www.oic.nsw.gov.au/agdbasev7wr/_assets/oic/m150001l2/consultation%20report%20-%20untangling%20the%20web.pdf#xml=http://PRODMWI15-0/isysquery/a046336b-68b9-45f5-846e-d81d8183673a/2/hilite/"
  from the Office of the Information Commissioner, NSW.

  For further arguments you can use see the Federal Government's
  "#{link_to "Declaration of Open Government", "http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/strategy-and-governance/gov2/declaration-of-open-government.html"}"
  of 2010 in which it was stated that the government supports
%blockquote
  &hellip; strengthening citizenâ€™s rights of access to information, establishing a pro-disclosure culture across Australian Government agencies including through online innovation, and making government information more accessible and usable

%h4
  I don't have the time or I don't have the skills. How can I help?
%p
  You value the service provided by PlanningAlerts but you simple don't have the time or the specialist skills to help out personally?
%p
  The best thing that you can do is to #{link_to "donate to the OpenAustralia Foundation", "http://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/donate/"}, the charity behind PlanningAlerts. Your donation will go to improving the service.

%h4
  I work for a local council or planning authority and would like to make our data available
%p
  The most important thing you can do is publish your data in a simple format that is freely available on the internet.
  Something <a href="/brisbane.xml">like this</a> is good but we can work with most formats.

%p
  Please
  = mail_to "contact@planningalerts.org.au", "get in touch"
  if you would like to discuss how you can help.

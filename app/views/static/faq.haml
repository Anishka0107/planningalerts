    What's a planning authority?

    Your local planning authority is the part of government that assesses planning and development applications.

    How can I stop receiving alerts?
  %dd
    At the bottom of each email you receive there is a link to unsubscribe from that alert. Just click on it and we'll
    delete your alert.
  %dt
    Do you cover the whole country?
  %dd
    No, but we are working on it. There is a list of the planning authorities we currently cover
    <a href="about.php#authorities">here</a>. Not every planning authority publishes their planning data online so some
    places will always be missing. If your local authority is missing, you could always
    <a href="about.php#contact">help out by writing a screen scraper to search their website.</a>
  %dt
    Can I help?
  %dd
    Yes please! To be able to cover the whole country we need help in writing screen scrapers to search the websites of
    every planning authority in the country. If you'd like to write one for your local planning authority
    <a href="about.php#contact">get in touch</a>.

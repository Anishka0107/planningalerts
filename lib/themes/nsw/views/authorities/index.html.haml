  This service doesn't yet cover all of NSW, but we are working on it. If you're looking for a service
  with national Australian coverage go to #{link_to "PlanningAlerts", "http://www.planningalerts.org.au"}.
%p
  New authorities are being added all the time, so if your local authority isn't listed below
  #{link_to "sign up anyway", new_alert_path} and you'll start receiving alerts once it has been included.
%p
  We currently cover #{Authority.nsw_percentage_population_covered_by_all_active_authorities.to_i}% of NSW's population within #{@authorities["NSW"].count} authorities.
%p
  From time to time planning authorities change their websites which breaks the scrapers that gather the planning
  data. In the list below you can also see the authorities that we haven't received planning data from for a while
  which is a good indication that something is wrong. These are marked as
  <span class="highlight">possibly broken</span>.

%ul.authorities
  - @authorities["NSW"].each do |authority|
